# Olive Solve - Tetra3 Solver in Rust

A fast, robust, and async-friendly Rust implementation and optimization of the [cedar-solve](https://github.com/smroid/cedar-solve) centroid extraction and plate solving algorithms. 

## Repository Structure

This workspace is divided into two primary crates:

* **`tetra3`**: The core algorithms. `solver.rs` is a Rust port of the [Tetra3](https://github.com/smroid/cedar-solve/blob/master/tetra3/tetra3.py) `solve_from_centroids` function. `extractor.rs` is a Rust port of the `get_centroids_from_image` function. `tetra3.rs` provides the standard interface corresponding to the Python project.
* **`tetra3-py`**: Python bindings for the optimized tetra3 Rust implementation.
* **`server`**: A gRPC server that exposes tetra3's algorithms as a service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* [Rust / Cargo](https://rustup.rs/)
* Python 3

### Building
To build the workspace:

```
cargo build --release
```

### Testing

A set of real-world test data is provided for validating the algorithms and the wrappers.

#### Validation Tests

From the project root, run:

```
cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1
```

Optionally add `--nocapture` to the end of the command above to print the full test ouput to `stdout`.

#### Tests for Python Bindings

From the `tetra3-py` root, run:

```
./test_python_wrapper.sh
```

#### Performance Tests

The solver tests provide a performance report at the end of the output:

```
cargo test --release test_solver_consistency_with_testdata -- --nocapture
```

To compare the extraction performance against the original `cedar-solve` implementation:

1. Clone [cedar-solve](https://github.com/smroid/cedar-solve)
2. Run `./setup.sh` in the `cedar-solve` root.
3. Source the Python activation script:
```
source ../cedar-solve/.cedar_venv/bin/activate
```
4. From the repo root run:
```
cargo test --release test_performance_vs_python -- --nocapture --test-threads=1 --ignored
```

To compare the extraction performance against `cedar-detect`, run:

```
cargo test --release test_performance_vs_python -- --nocapture --test-threads=1 --ignored
```

## FAQ

1\. Why not port the database generation function?

Database generation is a one-time operation that doesn't benefit from a port.

2\. How can I generate an appropriate database?

Refer to [cedar-solve](https://github.com/smroid/cedar-solve/blob/master/tetra3/tetra3.py) or [esa/tetra](https://github.com/esa/tetra3/blob/master/tetra3/tetra3.py) for database generation. Note that the 2 versions of tetra3 have slightly different database formats, but this Rust implementation is compatible with both.

3\. What kind of performance gain can I expect to see for the solver?

On a Raspberry Pi 5 with 4 GB RAM the Rust version ~130x faster. On a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with 512 MB of RAM the Rust version has a similar performance gain. In both cases solves in the `cedar-server` pipeline take well under 1 ms.

4\. What kind of performance gain can I expect to see for the extractor?

Benchmarks on the Raspberry Pi 5 with 4 GB RAM show ~15x improvement over the extractor in `cedar-solve`.

5\. How does the extractor port compare to `cedar-detect`?

`cedar-detect` is up to 2x as fast. The extractor port here uses the same algorithm as `cedar-solve` and produces the same results. `cedar-detect` provides a custom algorithm.
